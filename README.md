# PainGenerator
A small Python program which generates random, or custom, images in the style of certain textures in the video game 'Cruelty Squad'. I learned Python with this project which is why the code is badly written, mismatched, and probably not very efficient ;).

This page is just an easy way to get the source code in case you'd like to tinker with the program and run it in your own python environment, for a fully functional .exe with no requirements needed, head to : <come back later>
